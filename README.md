# NLP Text Preprocessing Task

This repository showcases a set of common Natural Language Processing (NLP) text cleaning techniques, completed as part of an internship assignment.

## 🔍 Techniques Applied
- Lowercasing
- URL Removal
- Emoji Removal
- Punctuation Removal
- Stopword Filtering
- Lemmatization

## 📁 Structure
- `notebook.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing step-by-step implementation of each technique.
- Sample text is used to demonstrate each method independently.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- Regular Expressions (`re` module)

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open `notebook.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
3. Run each cell to see the preprocessing steps in action

## 📌 Notes
This project is designed for educational and demonstration purposes. Feel free to modify or extend it for your own NLP tasks.
